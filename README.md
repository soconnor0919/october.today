# October.Today

A simple website that displays the date as if October 2019 never ended.

## About

This website is based on a running joke between friends where we count the days as if we're still in October 2019. Instead of showing today's actual date, it displays it as "October Nth, 2019" where N is the number of days since October 1, 2019.

## How It Works

The site uses JavaScript to:
1. Calculate the number of days since October 1, 2019
2. Display the result as "October [day count]" with the appropriate ordinal suffix (st, nd, rd, th)
